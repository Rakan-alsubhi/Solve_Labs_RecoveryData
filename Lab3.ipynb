      "The fundamental challenge: Even though we used the same color system across all three sensors, different camera modules vary in terms of color and sensitivity. To allow for that, our engineers precisely calibrate each camera individually for things like white balance and exposure. Then they push it even further, pairing the three cameras and calibrating them again for module-to-module alignment.\n",
      "Those calibrations are applied to every image you capture — in real time. It’s like taking raw images from three different cameras and processing them to achieve a consistent look and color. Except it happens in a split second. Getting those details right, on the fly, as you switch from Telephoto to Wide to Ultra Wide, takes the kind of computational power only A13 Bionic provides.\n",
      "We also wanted each of the cameras to be accessible with a single tap, all the time. No matter whether you’re shooting photos, portraits, videos, time lapse, or slo-mo. And we were determined to have beautifully smooth transitions from one camera to the next.\n",

      "Then the camera software goes to work. It aligns images to correct for movement. It discards the sections with too much blur and fuses sharper ones. It adjusts contrast so everything stays in balance. It fine-tunes colors so they look natural. Then it intelligently de-noises and enhances details to produce the final image.\n",

      "The new Super Retina XDR display is our best display ever in an iPhone. Not only is it brighter and smarter, it’s also up to 15 percent more power efficient.\n",
      "How did we improve performance and efficiency at the same time? Since each pixel emits its own light, the display can turn off individual pixels to produce true blacks. On the flip side, we improved communication between the display driver and the display, used a more efficient OLED material, and optimized the panel design to reach two new record levels of brightness — one in sunlight and one while viewing HDR photos and movies.\n",
      "So if you’re at home watching a thriller with a fireball exploding against the night sky, the Super Retina XDR display intelligently illuminates the fireball-related pixels up to 1200 nits, while the pixels around it stay deep black. This ability to identify the brightest parts of the display and drive them to a higher peak brightness helps iPhone 11 Pro deliver a stunning picture like you’d see on our Pro Display XDR.\n",

      "It takes a ton of processing power to shoot 4K video at 60 fps.\n",
      "We built A13 Bionic to deliver unparalleled speed and advanced machine learning. It’s what allows iPhone 11 Pro to power through processor-intensive tasks. Shooting 4K video at 60 fps in extended dynamic range, for instance, is like a firehose of information hitting the video encoder at once. Processing it would be a challenge for most chips. But A13 rips right through it.\n",
      "Think of video as a series of frames. Thanks to incredibly fast camera sensors, iPhone 11 Pro is able to produce 120 frames per second, alternating between standard exposure and short exposure frames.\n",
      "The image signal processor and video encoders analyze each of those frames in the moment to capture as much detail as possible. To take it even further, the Neural Engine uses real-time machine learning to optimize the different components of the scene. For example, it might relight the person in the foreground, while reducing noise and enhancing color in the sky. It all happens instantly and automatically.\n",

      "The battery is only part of the story.\n",
      "Delivering up to five more hours of battery life isn’t just about building a better battery.1 It’s about making the entire system work together. That means engineering everything — the battery, the chip, the display, the software — to give you more performance with greater efficiency.\n",
      "The Super Retina XDR display is up to 15 percent more power efficient than the display in iPhone Xs. iOS 13 takes advantage of the custom-built performance controller to route tasks throughout the chip in the most efficient way possible. And A13 Bionic leverages four custom high-efficiency cores for everyday tasks.\n",
      "Another important piece of the puzzle is the Apple-designed power management unit (PMU). Think of the PMU as an orchestra, and A13 Bionic as its conductor. The chip tells the PMU exactly where and when to distribute power across iPhone, and the PMU delivers it with expert precision. The result? Increased performance only when it’s needed, which helps to preserve power.\n",
